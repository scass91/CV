## Simon Cass

A resourceful and results-driven individual with five years' experience working in numerical analytical roles with a recent focus on asset risk. I am seeking new challenges in a new industry after an enjoyable start to my career. 

I am a full-stack junior developer, recently graduated from Makers, and am looking for a role where I can continue to learn and grow at a rapid pace. I have a Mathematics degree, with a years study abroad in the US, and I am a keen traveller having visited 30 different countries so far.

## Skills

#### Clean Code

Throughout my time at Makers Academy I learned about the merits of having a readable codebase, as well as the potential pitfalls which can happen if a codebase is not readable. During the course, programming principles such as SOLID & DRY, as well as exposure to XP values in group situtations were all utilised to ensure best practice. TDD is a huge driver in keeping code efficient, clean & as bug-free as possible - I am a huge fan of this approach to developing software. 

#### Communication

During my time at Motability Operations I attended meetings internally with stakeholders of varying seniority. My role in these meetings was to communicate the findings of our team in a simple, non-technical way to various members of the business, and then give recommendations on what actionable steps should be taken next in order to meet our business goals.

During my time as a Senior Analyst within the vehicle risk team at Motability Operations I had to frequently represent the business at external events with automotive manufacturers, some of which represented over 10% of our total business - as a result knowing how best to convey sometimes difficult messages was key.

#### Creative & Critical thinker

I have consistently sought out opportunities to improve efficiency of processes during my working life. I am a firm believer in not wasting time on laborious tasks, one example of this was during my time as a Pricing Analyst whereby I inherited a report which was manually refreshed 3 times a month, and often took a few hours to complete. I rewrote the report using various Business Objects reports & VBA macros. As a result of this the report would automatically refresh and would only require a few minutes to check before being sent out to various stakeholders both internal and external. After this, I had more time to spend on tasks which weren't able to be automated and therefore could dedicate more resources to these more difficult tasks.
