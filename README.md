## Simon Cass

A resourceful and results-driven individual with five years' experience working in numerical analytical roles with a recent focus upon organisational and asset risk. I have a proven track record in taking ownership of large portfolios and acting proactively to minimise business financial risk. I am seeking new challenges in a new industry after an enjoyable start to my career in the automotive industry.

Currently I am on an intensive training course at Makers Academy in London. I have a Mathematics degree with a years study abroad in the US, and I am a keen traveller having visited 30 different countries so far.
