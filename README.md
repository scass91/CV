## Simon Cass

A resourceful and results-driven individual with five years' experience working in numerical analytical roles with a recent focus on asset risk. I have a proven track record in taking ownership of large portfolios and acting proactively to minimise business financial risk. I am seeking new challenges in a new industry after an enjoyable start to my career in the automotive industry.

Currently I am on an intensive training course at Makers Academy in London. I have a Mathematics degree with a years study abroad in the US, and I am a keen traveller having visited 30 different countries so far.

## Skills

#### Communication

During my time at Motability Operations I attended meetings internally with stakeholders of varying seniority. My role in these meetings was to communicate the findings of our team in a simple, non-technical way to various members of the business, and then give recommendations on what actionable steps should be taken next in order to meet our business goals.

During my time as a Senior Analyst within the vehicle risk team at Motability Operations I had to frequently represent the business at external events with automotive manufacturers, some of which represented over 10% of our total business - as a result knowing how best to convey sometimes difficult messages was key.

#### Creative & Critical thinker

I have consistently sought out opportunities to improve efficiency of processes during my working life. I am a firm believer in not wasting time on laborious tasks, one example of this was during my time as a Pricing Analyst whereby I inherited a report which was manually refreshed 3 times a month, and often took a few hours to complete. I rewrote the report using various Business Objects reports & VBA macros. As a result of this the report would automatically refresh and would only require a few minutes to check before being sent out to various stakeholders both internal and external. After this, I had more time to spend on tasks which weren't able to be automated and therefore could dedicate more resources to these more difficult tasks.
